Yes, the Python tabula library can read tables from PDF files, even if they contain different data formats and spaces. tabula-py is a Python wrapper for tabula-java, which allows you to extract tables from PDFs and convert them into pandas DataFrames, CSV, TSV, or JSON files.
However, handling tables with complex structures, such as merged cells or irregular spacing, can be challenging. Here are a few tips to improve the extraction process:
- Use the lattice option: This can help with tables that have clear borders.

import tabula
df = tabula.read_pdf("your_file.pdf", pages='all', lattice=True)

- Multiple tables: If your PDF contains multiple tables, you can use the multiple_tables option.

dfs = tabula.read_pdf("your_file.pdf", pages='all', multiple_tables=True)

- Post-processing: Sometimes, additional processing with pandas is necessary to clean up the extracted data.

import pandas as pd
df = pd.concat(dfs)

For more complex tables, you might need to convert the PDF to HTML first and then use pandas to read the tables.
