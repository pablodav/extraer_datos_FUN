This script does the following:

1. Parses the input data, separating it into events.
2. Creates a pandas DataFrame for each event.
3. Analyzes the event data, providing basic statistics.
4. Creates two plots for each event:
   - A box plot showing the time distribution by team
   - A scatter plot showing the relationship between age and time, color-coded by team

To use this script with your actual data, you would need to replace the `sample_content` with the content from your CSV files. You can do this by reading the files and concatenating their contents.

Here's a brief explanation of the analytics and visualizations:

1. Basic statistics: For each event, we calculate the number of participants, average time, fastest time, and slowest time. This gives a quick overview of the event's performance metrics.

2. Box plot (Time Distribution by Team): This visualization shows the distribution of times for each team. It allows you to compare the performance of different teams, identifying which teams have the best overall performance and which have the most consistent swimmers.

3. Scatter plot (Time vs Age by Team): This plot shows the relationship between a swimmer's age and their performance time, with different colors for each team. This can help identify any age-related trends in performance and how they might differ between teams.

These visualizations can help identify patterns such as:
- Which teams consistently perform better
- Whether older swimmers tend to be faster or slower
- Which teams have the most variation in performance
- Any outliers or exceptional performances

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail or suggest any additional analyses?
